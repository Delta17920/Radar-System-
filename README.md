This project is a simple radar system built using an Arduino Uno, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and SG90 servo motor to detect objects and their distances. The system utilizes Processing software for real-time visual representation of detected objects.

The complete code for both the Arduino and Processing platforms can be found in this repository.
